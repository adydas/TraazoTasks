sfWidgetFormInputSWFUploadPlugin
======================

sfWidgetFormInputSWFUploadPlugin decorates a file input widget with queued
uploading capabilities, provided by SWFUpload (www.swfupload.org).

This plugin is now an required dependancy of sfFilebasePlugin. See at its
sample project to see it in action.

Instructions:
=============

Use the widget like an ordinary file upload widget and configure it by
passing custom options to its options array.

In custom form you'd to probably manually include the widgets assets (javascripts
and stylesheets). Do so by using $myform->getJavascripts() and
$myform->getStylesheets().

Example:

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" accept-charset="utf-8">
      <?php foreach($form->getJavascripts() AS $javascript):?>
        <?php use_javascript($javascript)?>
      <?php endforeach?>
      <?php foreach($form->getStylesheets() AS $link => $media):?>
      <?php use_stylesheet($link)?>
      <?php endforeach?>
      <?php echo $form->render()?>
    </form>

Feel free to override the css to fit your own
applications look and feel.
